### Hi, I'm Yann!
🙇‍♂️ I'm Machine Learning Engineer🤖 in Tokyo🗼🇯🇵 and co-founder of [zeteoh](https://www.zeteoh.com/en-about-us/) 🇵

💎 zeteoh's mission is bringing intelligence🧠 to IoTs🤳🏾 and microcontrollers🐞 to make our environment smarter ✅ 

👉 Our first product, **zeteoh mobile sdk**[[ENG](https://www.zeteoh.com/en/) /[JPN](https://www.zeteoh.com/)] aims to enable **mobile game developers** 👩‍💻 to use **daily physical activities**🚵🏼‍♂️ in their games🕹 to increase their **users engagement**🏆. For that, it uses a tiny deep learning model directly deployed on user's smartphones that is able to recognize various types of physical activities with a high accuracy. 

🤔 Imagine a RPG🎮 on your phone📲, you would have to walk, climb stairs, run🏃‍♀️, etc, to increase your character's level💪! And running with your friends🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️🏃‍♀️ would allow you to increase even faster📈 to clear a dungeons🦑 and be the best in your area🌇! A kind of PokemonGO but focused on daily physical activities instead of the map!

👩‍💻You are **independent or amateur mobile game developer** and want to provide unique experience⁉️ Get a **free access to our solution**❗️ **Contact us** via our website: https://www.zeteoh.com/en/
