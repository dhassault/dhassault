💎 zeteoh's mission is bringing intelligence🧠 to IoTs🤳🏾 and microcontrollers🐞 to make people's life better 

👉 Our first product, **zeteoh mobile sdk**[[ENG](https://www.zeteoh.com/en/) /[JPN](https://www.zeteoh.com/)] aims to enable **mobile game developpers** 👩‍💻 to use **daily physicial activities**🚵🏼‍♂️ in their games🕹 to increase their **users engagement**🏆. 

🤔 Imagine a RPG🎮 on your phone📲, you would have to walk, climb stairs, run🏃‍♀️, etc, to increase your character's level💪! And running with your friends🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️🏃‍♀️ would allow you to increase even faster📈 to clear a dungeons🦑 and be the best in your area🌇! A kind of PokemonGO but focused on daily physicial activities instead of the map!
