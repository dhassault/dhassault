### Hi, I'm Yann!
I'm Machine Learning Engineer🤖 and co-founder of [zeteoh](https://www.zeteoh.com/en-about-us/) in Tokyo🗼🇯🇵

We are creating products leveraging Machine Learning that we are deploying on edge devices🤳🏾 and microcontrollers🐞. As example, zeteoh mobile sdk aims to enable mobile game developpers👩‍💻 to use daily physicial activities in their games🕹 to increase their users engagement. 

Imagine🤔 a RPG🎮 on your phone📲, you would have to walk, climb stairs, run🏃‍♀️, etc, to increase your character's level💪! And running with your friends🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️🏃‍♀️ would allow you to increase even faster📈 to clear a dungeons🦑 and be the best in your area🌇!
